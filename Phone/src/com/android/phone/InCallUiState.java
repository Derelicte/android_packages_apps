/**
 * Helper class to keep track of "persistent state" of the in-call UI.
 *
 * The onscreen appearance of the in-call UI mostly depends on the current
 * Call/Connection state, which is owned by the telephony framework.  But
 * there's some application-level "UI state" too, which lives here in the
 * phone app.
 *
 * This application-level state information is *not* maintained by the
 * InCallScreen, since it needs to persist throughout an entire phone call,
 * not just a single resume/pause cycle of the InCallScreen.  So instead, that
 * state is stored here, in a singleton instance of this class.
 *
 * The state kept here is a high-level abstraction of in-call UI state: we
 * don't know about implementation details like specific widgets or strings or
 * resources, but we do understand higher level concepts (for example "is the
 * dialpad visible") and high-level modes (like InCallScreenMode) and error
 * conditions (like CallStatusCode).
 *
 * @see InCallControlState for a separate collection of "UI state" that
 * controls all the onscreen buttons of the in-call UI, based on the state of
 * the telephony layer.
 *
 * The singleton instance of this class is owned by the PhoneApp instance.

    // (3) Error / diagnostic indications
    //

    // This section provides an abstract concept of an "error status
    // indication" for some kind of exceptional condition that needs to be
    // communicated to the user, in the context of the in-call UI.
    //
    // If mPendingCallStatusCode is any value other than SUCCESS, that
    // indicates that the in-call UI needs to display a dialog to the user
    // with the specified title and message text.
    //
    // When an error occurs outside of the InCallScreen itself (like
    // during CallController.placeCall() for example), we inform the user
    // by doing the following steps:
    //
    // (1) set the "pending call status code" to a value other than SUCCESS
    //     (based on the specific error that happened)
    // (2) force the InCallScreen to be launched (or relaunched)
    // (3) InCallScreen.onResume() will notice that pending call status code
    //     is set, and will actually bring up the desired dialog.
    //
    // Watch out: any time you set (or change!) the pending call status code
    // field you must be sure to always (re)launch the InCallScreen.
    //
    // Finally, the InCallScreen itself is responsible for resetting the
    // pending call status code, when the user dismisses the dialog (like by
    // hitting the OK button or pressing Back).  The pending call status code
    // field is NOT cleared simply by the InCallScreen being paused or
    // finished, since the resulting dialog needs to persist across
    // orientation changes or if the screen turns off.

    // TODO: other features we might eventually need here:
    //
    //   - Some error status messages stay in force till reset,
    //     others may automatically clear themselves after
    //     a fixed delay
    //
    //   - Some error statuses may be visible as a dialog with an OK
    //     button (like "call failed"), others may be an indefinite
    //     progress dialog (like "turning on radio for emergency call").
    //
    //   - Eventually some error statuses may have extra actions (like a
    //     "retry call" button that we might provide at the bottom of the
    //     "call failed because you have no signal" dialog.)
